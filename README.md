## SWTOR Textures Upscaler
A fork of [**Hasib345's Texture_Upscaler**](https://github.com/Hasib345/Texture_Upscaler) ([Hasib345's Blender Market's Add-on's page](https://blendermarket.com/products/texture-upscaler---image-upscaler-for-blender)).


**This fork is a means to experiment with enhancing the textures of the Star Wars: The Old Republic (SWTOR) game (.dds format, which Blender can import but can't export, usually "packed" with multiple types of maps in a same image file).**

The idea is to have it export the images to be enhanced as PNG, WebP or JPG instead, saving them alongside the original .dds ones, and have the add-on assign them back instead. Also, it's about seeing ways to integrate the upscaler executable in other SWTOR-related tools (it's the first time I toy with a Blender add-on that interacts with a command line UI-executable).

As there are cases where the game's texture files will have very disparate data per channel that would suffer if enhanced as if they where full RGB images, I might have to investigate separating the channels into greyscale images, enhancing them, and combining them back ðŸ¤”.

About ESRGAN:

[Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) aims at developingÂ Practical Algorithms for General Image/Video Restoration.  
We extend the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data.  

[ncnn](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) is a high-performance neural network inference computing framework optimized for mobile platforms. ncnn is deeply considerate about deployment and uses on mobile phones from the beginning of design. ncnn does not have third party dependencies.

This addon is theÂ [ncnn](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan)Â [implementation](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan) ofÂ Real-ESRGANÂ in blender .Â 

This addon only works on Windows Operating Systems (For Now) .

**Additional links:**

If you want to add another model in the addon you can get the models for [this page](https://github.com/Hasib345/Custom_models)Â 

To add custom models to the addon there is an option in addon preferences.
